Hi, thanks for checking this short project out!<br><br> 

I'm very interested in public policy research, and being on a team that works with data informing public policy is one of my main career aspirations.<br><br>

This project is intended as an additional way to demonstrate my experience with some of the key skills mentioned on the job posting (Python, Tableau, etc.). It comprised of a brief data search on the Census Bureau's <a href="https://data.census.gov/map/040XX00US49,49$8600000?t=Income+and+Poverty&layer=VT_2023_860_Z2_PY_D1&loc=39.5448,-112.7272,z6.0000">website<a>, some data cleaning and preprocessing using python and a Jupyter Notebook, and the creation of a Tableau <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/CensusDataDemonstration/Dashboard-UtahFamilyCountEstimatebyZipCodeYear?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">dashboard<a>. There is also some screenshot documentation of my process. <br><br>

I'm unsure of how long the position will remain open, so I had to keep the project short (~10 hours from start to finish). If you would like other demonstrations of competency in the skills mentioned on the job posting, please reach out to me at goblejax@gmail.com, or look around at the rest of my Github account. <br><br>

Thank you for considering my application, I look forward to hearing from you soon, <br><br>
