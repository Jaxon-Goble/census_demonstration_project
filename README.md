Hi, thanks for checking this quick census data visualizaion project out!<br><br> 

This project is intended as a way to demonstrate my experience with some of the key skills mentioned on the job posting (Python, Tableau, the Census Bureau website). It included a brief data search on the Census Bureau's <a href="https://data.census.gov/map/040XX00US49,49$8600000?t=Income+and+Poverty&layer=VT_2023_860_Z2_PY_D1&loc=39.5448,-112.7272,z6.0000">website<a>, some data cleaning and preprocessing using python and a Jupyter Notebook, and the creation of a Tableau <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/CensusDataDemonstration/Dashboard-UtahFamilyCountEstimatebyZipCodeYear?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">dashboard<a>. In addition, I included screenshots for documentation of my process. <br><br>

The specific data used was the American Community Survey 5 year estimates from 2011-2023, covering all listed zip codes in Utah. It was downloaded as a csv, then cleaned using the Jupyter notebook included in this repository. The majority of the dataset was not used for analysis or visualization due to the scope of this project, though there is plenty of room for further work. The dataset itself is not included in the repo due to size restrictions on Github, but I can provide it if requested (or it can be found on the Census Bureau website). <br><br>

There wasn't much time for an in-depth analysis of trends or model development, this is primarily a demonstration of capabilities in regard to data cleaning and visualization. With that said, I did find a few interesting trends:<br>
1. The vast majority of the state saw substantial growth rates during the time period, especially Utah County and St. George.
2. Rural areas tended to grow significantly less or even shrink in family count estimates.
3. Zip codes around major highway systems tended to be smaller, indicating areas of more dense population. Determining whether this is the result of the highways being built, or if the highways were built to accomodate already densely-populated regions would require broader historical data, including population density charts, historical mapping of zip codes, and insight into the highway planning committee reasoning. <br>

Caveat: Though the map visualization can be used as a form of population density tool, the difference in size of zip codes makes it a poor representation for actual representations of population density. A more appropriate method would involve per square mile or kilometer estimates and visualizations. <br><br>

I was unsure of how long the position will remain open, so I had to keep the project simple and concise (~8 hours from start to finish). If you would like other demonstrations of competency in the skills mentioned on the job posting, please reach out to me at goblejax@gmail.com, or explore the rest of my Github. <br><br>

Thanks again, I look forward to hearing from you! <br><br>
